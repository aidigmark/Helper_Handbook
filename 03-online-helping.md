# Chapter 3: Online Helping

*Making an impact from anywhere with an internet connection*

## The Rise of Remote Volunteering

You don't need to leave your couch to change lives. Remote and online volunteering has exploded, opening helping opportunities to people who can't volunteer locally due to disability, caregiving responsibilities, rural location, or simply schedule constraints.

Online helping spans everything from five-minute micro-tasks to ongoing relationships. Whatever time and skills you have, there's a match.

## Crisis Support Lines

Some of the most impactful online volunteering involves directly supporting people in crisis.

### Text and Chat-Based Support

**Crisis Text Line**
- What: Text-based support for people in crisis
- Commitment: 4 hours/week minimum after 30+ hour training
- Website: [crisistextline.org](https://crisistextline.org)
- Note: Also operates in UK (Shout), Canada, Ireland

**7 Cups**
- What: Online chat support for emotional well-being (not crisis-level)
- Commitment: Flexible, self-paced training
- Website: [7cups.com](https://7cups.com)

**Trevor Project**
- What: Crisis support for LGBTQ+ youth
- Commitment: Significant training, regular shifts

### What to Expect

Crisis support volunteering is intense but rewarding:
- **Training is substantial**: Expect 20-40+ hours before taking your first conversation
- **Supervision is ongoing**: Regular check-ins, support for difficult conversations
- **Emotional processing is essential**: You'll hear hard things; organizations provide debriefing
- **Impact is immediate**: You're often the difference between someone's worst moment and getting help

### Is This Right for You?

Crisis support is a good fit if you:
- Are emotionally stable and have good boundaries
- Can commit to regular shifts for months
- Are comfortable with difficult topics (suicide, abuse, trauma)
- Have strong listening skills (or want to develop them)
- Have access to a private, quiet space during shifts
