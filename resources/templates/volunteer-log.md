## Tips for Effective Tracking

### Why Track?

- **Accountability**: Seeing progress motivates continued effort
- **Patterns**: Identify what works and what doesn't
- **Records**: Some employers, schools, or tax situations require documentation
- **Reflection**: Transform experience into learning

### What to Record

**Minimum:**
- Date
- Organization
- Hours

**Better:**
- Activity description
- Skills used or developed
- Contact person

**Best:**
- Impact observed (meals served, people helped, etc.)
- Reflections and learnings
- Follow-up items

### Verification

If you need verified hours (for school, court, employers):
- Get supervisor signature at each session
- Request official documentation from organization
- Keep contact information for references
