## Content Guidelines

### Tone and Style

- **Practical over inspirational**: Give actionable advice, not just motivation
- **Accessible language**: Write for a general audience, avoid jargon
- **Global perspective**: Remember readers come from many countries
- **Evidence-based**: Cite sources for claims, especially statistics
- **Balanced**: Present options without excessive advocacy for one approach

### Formatting

- Use Markdown formatting
- Include a table of contents for longer sections
- Break up long text with headers, lists, and tables
- Link to external resources where helpful
- Use relative links for internal handbook references

### Structure

Each chapter should include:

1. **Opening**: Brief overview of what the chapter covers
2. **Core content**: Main information and guidance
3. **Practical tips**: Specific, actionable advice
4. **Resources**: Links to tools, organizations, further reading
5. **Action steps**: Concrete next steps readers can take

### Word Counts

- Main chapters: 800-1500 words
- Resource lists: As needed for comprehensive coverage
- Templates: Keep concise and usable
